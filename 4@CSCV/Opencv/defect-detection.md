**3.fractal features and artificial neural network**

1. Fractal is a term used to describe the **shape** and **appearance** of the objects, which have the properties of **self-similarity** and **scale invariance**. Fractal dimension is ascale independent measure of the degree of surface roughness or boundary irregularity.
2.  feedforward backpropagation (BP) NN algorithm
